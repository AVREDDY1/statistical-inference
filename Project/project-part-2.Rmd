## Overview
Now in the second portion of the class, we're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.

## About the data
The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, (orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC).

A data frame with 60 observations on 3 variables.

[ ,1]	 len	 numeric	 Tooth length  
[ ,2]	 supp	 factor	 Supplement type (VC or OJ)   
[ ,3]	 dose	 numeric	 Dose in milligrams/day 

**Source: **C. I. Bliss (1952) The Statistics of Bioassay. Academic Press.

## Analysis

### 1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses 

```{R echo = TRUE}
library(datasets)
data <- ToothGrowth
head(ToothGrowth) # Taking a look at the first parts of the dataset
str(data)  # Taking a look at how the data object is structured
data$dose <- as.factor(data$dose) # Converting dose to factor instead of numeric
```

### 2. Provide a basic summary of the data
```{R echo = TRUE}
summary(data) # Summary of the dataset
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
ggplot(data, aes(x = dose, y = len, fill = supp)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_grid(. ~ supp) + labs(x = expression("Dose"[mg/day])) + ylab("Tooth length") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Supplement type (VC or OJ)\n")) + 
  ggtitle("The Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs") +
  theme_economist()
```

Observing the plot, we see that the amount of supplement (OJ or VC) given to a guinea pig seems to make their teeth grow bigger.

### 3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)

```{R echo = TRUE}
t.test(len ~ supp, data)
```
H~0~ = supplement type affects tooth growth: P-value (0.06063) is greater than 0.05, therefore we cannot reject the null hypothesis (H~0~).

```{R echo = TRUE}
data <- ToothGrowth # Fetching the data again (now we need dosage as numeric)
t.test(data$len, data$dose)
```
H~a~ = dosage affects tooth growth: P-value (< 2.2e-16 or < 0.00000000000000022) is less than 0.05, therefore we can reject the alternative hypothesis (H~a~).  

## 4. State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions
**Conclusions:**   
**H~0~ = supplement type affects tooth growth: **This hypothesis cannot be rejected. Which means that there is not enough evidence to affirm that the a type of supplement is better than the other.   
**H~a~ = dosage affects tooth growth: **This hypothesis can be rejected. Which means that the amount of supplement affects the tooth growth.Thus, when dosage is increased the guinea pig's tooth grows bigger.
**Assumptions: **   
1. The 60 guinea pigs used is the study represent the whole population of guinea pigs;   
2. Variance is different for the sample and the theoritical group.
